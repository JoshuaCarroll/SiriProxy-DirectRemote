SiriProxy-DirectRemote
======================

A SiriProxy plugin that enables Siri to control your DirecTV receiver.

This plugin is for use with @plamoni's SiriProxy.  It will allow the user to give Siri commands to send to 
your DirecTV receiver.  For example, you can say "What am I watching?", and Siri will reply with the name of 
the program you are watching and the channel it is on.

The only setup required is to set the value of the host variable in the config file.  This is the IP address 
of the DirecTV receiver that you want to associate with the plugin.

This is my first open-source project, and is some of my first work with Ruby.
